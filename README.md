![loading_status](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lingua-pupuli/puppet-vscode/master/docs/assets/loading_status.gif)


### Syntax Highlighting

Syntax highlighting recognizes all versions of Puppet and displays as you type.

- Puppet DSL
- Puppet Grammar
- Module metadata files

![syntax_highlighting](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lingua-pupuli/puppet-vscode/master/docs/assets/syntax_highlighting.png)

### Auto Completion

Auto complete Puppet types and classes and their parameter sets as you type. Tab completion works as you would expect.

![auto_complete](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lingua-pupuli/puppet-vscode/master/docs/assets/auto_complete.gif)

### Hover Support

Hovering over any resource, class declaration or other Puppet symbol provides instant contextual information. For example, hovering over the resource declaration lists the type name and parameter list, with all relevant help text.

![hover_support](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lingua-pupuli/puppet-vscode/master/docs/assets/hover_support.gif)

### Outline View

The new `Outline View` shows the symbol tree of the currently selected Puppet manifest. 

Supported symbols:

- Class
- Defined Type
- Attribute
- Variable

More symbols are planned to be added.

> Note: Puppet 4 is not supported for symbols

![outline_view](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lingua-pupuli/puppet-vscode/master/docs/assets/outline_view.gif)

### Breadcrumbs

When the `breadcrumbs.enabled` setting is set to true, both the file path and the symbol tree hierarchy are shown in the Breadcrumb view.

> Note: Puppet 4 is not supported for symbols

![breadcrumbs](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lingua-pupuli/puppet-vscode/master/docs/assets/breadcrumbs.gif)

### Go to Symbol

Opening the `Command Palette` and typing the `@` symbol initiates the `Go to Symbol` view which allows you to navigate around inside a Puppet manifest more quickly.

> Note: Puppet 4 is not supported for symbols

![go_to_symbol](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lingua-pupuli/puppet-vscode/master/docs/assets/go_to_symbol.gif)

### Code Snippets

As part of IntelliSense and Snippets, you can quickly create templates to automate repetitive series of code.

### Linting

Linting is automatically applied to the document as you edit, without having to save the file first. The validation uses [puppet-lint](https://github.com/rodjek/puppet-lint) to validate the Puppet syntax in all open puppet files. Errors and warnings appear in the Problems window in VSCode.

### Puppet Commands

#### Puppet Resource

You can import existing resources directly using `puppet resource`

1. Open the command palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`) or right click on a puppet file and select the menu entry

2. Type `puppet resource` and press enter

3. Enter the resource type you want to import, for example `user`

The information returned will be pasted into the open editor window where your cursor is resting, or at the begining of an empty file.

![puppet_resource](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lingua-pupuli/puppet-vscode/master/docs/assets/puppet_resource.gif)

#### Puppet Node Graph preview

You can preview the [node graph](https://puppet.com/blog/visualize-your-infrastructure-models) of a manifest while you edit your Puppet Code.

1. Open the command palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`) or right click on a puppet file and select the menu entry

2. Type `puppet open node`.. and press enter

The node graph will appear next to the manifest

![puppet_node_graph](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lingua-pupuli/puppet-vscode/master/docs/assets/puppet_node_graph.gif)

### Puppet Development Kit Support

You can use the [Puppet Development Kit](https://puppet.com/blog/develop-modules-faster-new-puppet-development-kit) inside VS Code from the command palette. To use any of the above commands, open the command palette and start typing a command. You can also use the right-click context menu or the editor menu to reach these commands.

** Note: The PDK must be installed prior to using these commands

** Note: `pdk convert` is not available in the command palette as it is a complicated command that requires user input to succeed. It is better to use it from the builtin terminal.

#### PDK new module

`PDK New Module` is available even if the extension isn't loaded, the rest of the commands are only available when the extension is loaded.

![pdk_new_module](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lingua-pupuli/puppet-vscode/master/docs/assets/pdk_new_module.gif)

#### PDK new class

You can create new classes using PDK using the VS Code command palette. This functionality is only available when a Puppet file has already been opened, to trigger the extension.

![pdk_new_class](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lingua-pupuli/puppet-vscode/master/docs/assets/pdk_new_class.gif)

#### PDK validate

You can initiate a valiadtion of your module using PDK using the VS Code command palette. This functionality is only available when a Puppet file has already been opened, to trigger the extension.

![pdk_validate](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lingua-pupuli/puppet-vscode/master/docs/assets/pdk_validate.gif)

#### PDK test unit

You can run the test suite of your module using PDK using the VS Code command palette. This functionality is only available when a Puppet file has already been opened, to trigger the extension.

![pdk_test_unit](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lingua-pupuli/puppet-vscode/master/docs/assets/pdk_test_unit.gif)

### Debugging Puppet manifests

**Note - This is an experimental feature**

The Puppet extension is able to debug the compilation of a Puppet manifest; much like the Go, PowerShell, and C# languages. The debugger supports:

* Line breakpoints but not conditions on those breakpoints
* Function breakpoints
* Exception breakpoints
* Call stack
* Variables, but only at the top stack frame
* Limited interactive debug console.  For example, you can assign a variable a value, but just as in regular Puppet you can't change its value later
* Step In, Out, and Over


![Puppet Debug Adapter](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lingua-pupuli/puppet-vscode/master/docs/assets/puppet_debug.gif)

The debugging features in the extension are based on the excellent ideas in [puppet-debugger](https://www.puppet-debugger.com/) by [Corey Osman](https://github.com/nwops).

#### Configuring the debug session

To debug a simple manifest in VS Code, press `F5` and VS Code will try to debug your currently active manifest by running the equivalent of `puppet apply`. Note that by default No Operation (`--noop`) is enabled so that your local computer will not be modified.

The [VSCode Debugging - Launch Configurations](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/debugging#_launch-configurations) website has instructions on how to configure the debug session with more advanced options.

#### Settings

- `manifest` - The manifest to apply.  By default this is the currently open file in the editor

- `noop` - Whether the `puppet apply` sets No Operation (Noop) mode.  By default, this is set to true.  This means when running the debugger it will not make changes to your system. The [documentation about the puppet agent](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/5.3/man/apply.html#OPTIONS) has more information about `puppet apply` and and the `noop` option.

- `args` - Additional arguements to pass to `puppet apply`, for example `['--debug']` will output debug information

## Installing the Extension

You can install the official release of the Puppet extension by following the steps in the [Visual Studio Code documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-gallery). In the Extensions pane, search for "puppet-vscode" extension and install it there. You will get notified automatically about any future extension updates!

![extension_install](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lingua-pupuli/puppet-vscode/master/docs/assets/extension_install.gif)

You can also install the extension without access to the internet by following these [instructions](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-gallery#_install-from-a-vsix.)

## Configuration

The Puppet VSCode extension can use the PDK or the Puppet Agent to provide advanced features, which can be set using two configuration options: `puppet.installType` and `puppet.puppetAgentDir`.

- By default the `puppet.installType` is set to `agent`, and allows you to choose to use `pdk` or `agent`.
- The `puppet.puppetAgentDir` allows you to choose a custom path to either a PDK install or a Puppet-Agent install, and must match the correct setting in `puppet.installType`.

If no settings are chosen, the extension will attempt to use the Puppet Agent, to force it to use the PDK you have to select `pdk` for `puppet.installType`.


**Note**: The `puppet.puppetAgentDir` setting name will be changed in the `0.12.0` release to `puppet.installDirectory`

**Note**: Only PDK v1.5.0 and above are supported.

### Configure extension to use PDK

To ensure that the extension uses the PDK, set the `puppet.installType` setting to the `pdk` value like so:

```json
{
  "puppet.installType":"pdk"
}
```

The default installation paths stored in the extension are:

```json
{
  // Windows
  "puppet.puppetAgentDir":"C:\\Program Files\\Puppet Labs\\DevelopmentKit",
  // Mac
  "puppet.puppetAgentDir":"/opt/puppetlabs/pdk",
  // Linux
  "puppet.puppetAgentDir":"/opt/puppetlabs/pdk"
}
```

To use a custom install path for the PDK, set the `puppet.puppetAgentDir` setting to the path you installed the PDK to:

```json
{
  "puppet.puppetAgentDir":"D:/programs/pdk"
}
```

### Configure extension to use Puppet-Agent

To ensure that the extension uses the Puppet-Agent, set the `puppet.installType` setting to the `puppet` value like so:

```json
{
  "puppet.installType":"puppet"
}
```

The default installation paths stored in the extension are:

```json
{
  // Windows
  "puppet.puppetAgentDir":"C:\\Program Files\\Puppet Labs\\Puppet",
  // Mac
  "puppet.puppetAgentDir":"/opt/puppetlabs",
  //Linux
  "puppet.puppetAgentDir":"/opt/puppetlabs"
}
```

To use a custom install path for the Puppet-Agent, set the `puppet.puppetAgentDir` setting to the path you installed the Puppet-Agent to:

```json
{
  "puppet.puppetAgentDir":"D:/programs/puppet"
}
```

## Experience a Problem?

### Puppet Agent Install

A commonly encountered problem is not having the PDK or Puppet Agent installed on the computer you are running VSCode on. As noted in the [Requirements section](https://github.com/lingua-pupuli/puppet-vscode/blob/master/README.md#requirements), you will need to have the PDK or Puppet Agent installed in order to fully use this extension, as the extension uses the Puppet binaries and the Ruby language bundled into the PDK or agent install in order to function.

If you are receiving an error right after opening a Puppet file saying that a Puppet Agent install could not be found, ensure that Puppet is installed on the system. The VSCode extension attempts to find a valid Puppet install if a path is not configured in `puppet.installDirectory` in `User Settings`, so if Puppet is installed but not in a default path please check that your setting points to the correct path.

### Reloading the Puppet VSCode extension

If you haven't see the Problems Pane update in awhile, or hover and intellisense doesn't seem to showing up, and you might not know what to do. Sometimes the Puppet extension can experience problems which cause the language server to crash or not respond. The extension has a way of logging the crash, but there is something you can do to get right back to working: reload the Puppet Language Server.

You can reload the Puppet Lanuguage Server by opening the command palette and starting to type `Puppet`. A list of Puppet commands will appear, select `Puppet: Restart Current Session`. This will restart the Puppet Language Server without reloading VSCode or losing any work currently open in the editor.
