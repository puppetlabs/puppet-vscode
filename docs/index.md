## Features
This project is a visual studio code extension which provides Puppet Language support, including the following features:

+ Syntax highlighting
+ Code snippets
+ Linting
+ IntelliSense for resources, parameters and more
+ Validation of `metadata.json` files
+ Import from `puppet resource` directly into manifests
+ Node graph preview
+ Puppet Development Kit integration
+ (Experimental) Local debugging of Puppet manifests

## Getting Started

Assuming you already have [Visual Studio Code]() installed and open, you'll need to open the extensions menu by doing one of the following:

+ Using a hotkey - `⇧⌘X` (MacOS) or `ctrl+shift+x` (Windows, Linux).
+ Clicking the extension icon on the activity bar
+ Navigating to `View -> Extensions` in the menu at the top of the program.

Once you have the extensions menu open, you can search for the extension in the search bar - searching on `puppet` should bring up the extension.
Make sure you click the install button for the extension called `Puppet`, not one called `Puppet Support`.

Once you install the extension, you'll have the option to reload the window - you can do so by clicking the button labeled `Reload` in the activity bar.

You should now have the extension installed - to activate it, however, you need to open a Puppet file - any file ending in `.pp` or `.epp` should start the extension.
